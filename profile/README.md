# Echoes.io

**Multi-POV storytelling platform** where characters' voices echo through interconnected narratives across different timelines.

## 🎭 What is Echoes?

Echoes is a platform for telling rich, layered stories from multiple perspectives. Each timeline represents a different narrative universe, with characters whose experiences resonate and connect across the stories.

### Timelines

- **🌿 Anima** - Stories of growth, support, and tenderness
- **❤️ Eros** - Tales of passion, intensity, and raw emotion  
- **🌸 Bloom** - Narratives of discovery, balance, and blossoming

## 🏗️ Architecture

Echoes is built as a modular, multi-repository system organized around content hierarchies and specialized services.

### Content Structure

```
Timeline (story universe)
├── Arc (story phase)
│   ├── Episode (story event)
│   │   ├── Part (optional subdivision)
│   │   │   └── Chapter (individual .md file)
```

Each chapter is a markdown file with structured frontmatter, enabling flexible organization and rich storytelling across **326 chapters** successfully migrated and organized.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type safety
- **Runtime**: Node.js ecosystem
- **Database**: SQLite with Kysely query builder
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking
- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive coverage
- **AI Integration**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) + OpenAI embeddings
- **Vector Search**: ChromaDB for semantic similarity

## 📚 Content Management

Stories are organized using a hierarchical file structure with consistent naming conventions:

- **Episodes**: 2-digit padding (`ep01`, `ep02`)
- **Chapters**: 3-digit padding (`ch001`, `ch005`)
- **Files**: `content/<arc-name>/<ep01-episode-title>/<ep01-ch001-pov-title>.md`

Each chapter includes structured metadata for character POV, timeline placement, location, and content statistics.

### Chapter Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
pov: string          # Point of view character
title: string        # Chapter title
date: string         # Publication date
timeline: string     # Timeline name (anima/eros/bloom)
arc: string          # Arc name
episode: number      # Episode number
part: number         # Part number
chapter: number      # Chapter number
excerpt: string      # Short description
location: string     # Scene location
outfit: string       # (optional) Character outfit
kink: string         # (optional) Content tags
---
```

## 🤖 AI-Powered Development

All repositories include pre-configured [Amazon Q CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) agents for intelligent assistance with repository-specific tasks and cross-project coordination.

### MCP Server Integration

The `@echoes-io/mcp-server` provides AI tools for content operations:

- **Content Operations**: `words-count`, `chapter-info`, `episode-info`
- **Tracker Operations**: `words-update`, `chapter-add`, `chapter-update`, `chapter-delete`
- **Book Generation**: `book-generate` for LaTeX compilation

### RAG System

The `@echoes-io/rag` system enables semantic search across all content:

- **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI-powered chapter embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Find similar content across timelines
- **Context Retrieval**: Intelligent context assembly for AI interactions
- **Timeline Awareness**: Search within specific narratives or across all content

## 🔄 Shared Workflows

The organization provides reusable GitHub Actions workflows for common tasks:

### Content Publishing

Timeline repositories can use the shared workflow for processing and publishing content:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Timeline Content

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths: ['content/**/*.md']

jobs:
  publish:
    uses: echoes-io/.github/.github/workflows/publish-content.yml@main
    with:
      timeline-name: 'anima'  # Change for each timeline
      content-path: 'content/'
      web-app-url: 'https://app.echoes.io'
    secrets:
      WEB_APP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WEB_APP_TOKEN }}
```

The workflow automatically:
- Processes markdown files with frontmatter
- Extracts metadata and calculates text statistics
- Uploads processed content to the web application
- Handles error reporting and artifacts

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Literary yet accessible** - Reflects the storytelling nature while remaining technically robust
- **Type-safe** - Strict TypeScript throughout for reliability
- **Modular** - Each package serves a single, well-defined purpose
- **Tested** - Comprehensive test coverage ensures quality
- **Consistent** - Unified structure and conventions across all repositories
- **AI-Enhanced** - Intelligent tooling for content creation and management

## 🌟 Current Status

**Active Development** - Core libraries complete and published to NPM. Content migration completed with 326 chapters organized across three timelines. MCP server and RAG system operational, books generator complete. Ready for web application development.
